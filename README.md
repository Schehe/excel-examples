## Overpower
This directory has a "Deck Construction.xlsx" which helps you create an overpower card game deck, preIQ . In "PreIQ P1" and"PreIQ P2" tabs, a VLOOKUP is used to return the ratings of the characters and also uses a pivot table to get partial information from the file "Overpower Catalog.xlsx". That information showed will be changed dynamically according to what characters and what missions the user selected from a list of possible options.
